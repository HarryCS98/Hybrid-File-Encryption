## Abstract
In this Project I am going to be looking at the security concerns for confidential files being worked on in insecure environments pertaining to the “work from home” orders to combat covid19. To do this I am going to be looking at both symmetric and asymmetric encryption and how he can combine them to create a solution to the identified security concerns which takes the shape of a file encryption program.
