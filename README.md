## Abstract
In this Project I am going to be looking at the security concerns for confidential files being worked on in insecure environments pertaining to the “work from home” orders to combat covid19. To do this I am going to be looking at both symmetric and asymmetric encryption and how he can combine them to create a solution to the identified security concerns which takes the shape of a file encryption program. 

## Solution that was created
The program is designed to encrypt any file using the AES (Advanced encryption standard) and use RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) also know as hybrid encryption this allows a public key to be shared meaning a private key never needs to be sent over an unsecure network. This is all then bundled up into a GUI to make it simple and easy to use, while allowing the user to change parameters.
